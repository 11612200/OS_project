Sudesh sharma has to handle multiple request. For exmaple a student request for one resource and other request for the other resource.
It is required that Sudesh has to give fixed time for each request so that each will get the time(equal).
And it also seen that a faculty can also request for a resource so there a queue for facutly as well. Since faculty is higher authority than students so their prirority is higher. So they can request before the student. But between the fauclty the time is divided as the same that each faculty will get the fixed amount of time so that each will get the time to use the resource.
